# Text for Everyone

> Because if text works well in one of the most popular systems programming languages, the entire world over can start to benefit properly.

This repository is an implementation of an up and coming proposal percolating through SG16, P1629 - Standard Text Encoding. It will also include implementations of some downstream ideas covered in Previous Work in this area, including Zach Laine's [Boost.Text (proposed)](https://github.com/tzlaine/text), Robot M. Fernandes's [libogonek](https://github.com/libogonek/ogonek), and Tom Honermann's [text_view](https://github.com/tahonermann/text_view).

Using advances from `std::ranges` and other foundational changes made in C++20, this library is going to produce a flexible, backwards-compatible implementation that can compete with the fast implementations already found in Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, Qt and more.

# Current Plans

The current roadmap is to obtain funding to make [the current goals](/docs/funding/2019.09.21 - Towards Text in the Standard Library - ThePhD.pdf) viable in time for standardization for C++23.

Please considering sponsoring the work via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/users/ThePhD/sponsorship) or [other avenues](https://thephd.github.io/support/) so that this can be finished to allow [Study Group 16 - Unicode](https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16) to further support for additional, groundbreaking Unicode facilities in the C++ Standard Library.vV
