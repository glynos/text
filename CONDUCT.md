`phd.text` Contributor Code of Conduct
=======================================


Introduction
------------

- Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.
- Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for **everyone**.
- This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities, in all community venues— online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety or well-being of community members.


Expected Behavior
-----------------

- Be welcoming!
- Be kind.
- Look out for each other.


Unacceptable Behavior
---------------------

The following behaviors are unacceptable (both online and in any place where Contributors of this project physically gather):

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.


Enforcement
-----------

- This Code of Conduct applies in both word, and in spirit.
- Understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated.
- If an issue occurs, please contact ThePhD.
- If violations occur, action deemed appropriate for the infraction, up to and including expulsion of that member from the community (issues, commits, general discussion, etc.).
- Communities are not courts: it is up to the judgement of those moderating (ThePhD) to make a decision based on the evidence at hand.
- Extremely poor behavior outside of this project can disqualify an individual's participation in the project if that conduct is so excessively harmful that it would make it dangerous or exceedingly uncomfortable to work or participate with that individual present.
